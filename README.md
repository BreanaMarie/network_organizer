Network Organizer

Introduction:
This is an application designed for people who are looking to expand their social network and have difficulty keeping track of which companies or people they have contacted and when.

Users can create a profile which retains data about various companies the user is currently communicating with.  Each company a user inputs into their personal file will hold details about when they have contacted the company, who the contacts are at the company and methods for which to contact them.

Further Development:
Down the road this app will include events or reminders that let the user know what dates they need to pay attention to, possibly displayed in a list, with a synchronization to the calendar.  There is also a plan for additional fields that can be added by the user for further customization.
Another idea is to have a user share a read only mode of their network with their career coach to help them get feed back on their networking progress.
