Pavement Pounder

is an application designed for people who are looking for work in many places, and have difficulty keeping track of which companies they have contacted and when.

Users can create a profile which retains data about companies the user is currently communicating with in order to gain employment.  Each company a user imputs into their personal file will hold details about when they have contacted the company, who the contacts at the company are, events or reminders that let the user know what dates they need to pay attention to.  There are also additional fields that can be added by the user for further custimization.
